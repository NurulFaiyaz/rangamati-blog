    <div class="firstp">
<p> After Eid Ul Adha. I planed for take a tour of Rangamati. It was feel so refreshing. usually I have no time to go a tour because of my job.</p>
<p> First of all, I woke up early in the morning to take a early tour. But I had to wash some clothes. For that reason I came to my house and washed them. After that I move out to take my bus. From my house to bus station it takes 40-50 minutes.</p>
